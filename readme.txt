== Key Features: ==

**Customizable Messaging:** Present options like "Include a small processing fee to support our services" or "Add [calculated fee] to cover transaction costs," with the fee amount displayed inline for clarity.

**Flexible Fee Structures:** Set percentage-based fees, flat rates, or a combination (e.g., 2.9% + $0.30) to align with your payment processor's charges.

User Empowerment: Allow customers to choose whether to cover transaction fees, fostering transparency and trust.

Seamless Integration: Easily incorporate the fee field into any Gravity Form, with automatic fee calculation based on the form's total.
